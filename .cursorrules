# StereoKit Project - Linear + GitHub Integration Workflow

## Standard Development Workflow

### 1. Starting Work on a Linear Issue
1. **Fetch issue details**: Use Linear integration to get issue ID (e.g., MAN-11)
2. **Create branch**: Use Linear-suggested branch name format
3. **Update issue status**: Linear auto-moves to "In Progress" when branch is created

### 2. Development Process
1. **Implement features** according to Linear issue description
2. **Test on Quest 3** when applicable (especially hand tracking features)
3. **Commit with detailed messages** including issue reference

### 3. Commit Message Format
```
Brief description for ISSUE-ID

- Key implementation details
- Technical decisions and optimizations
- Quest 3 considerations if applicable

Addresses ISSUE-ID: Original issue title
```

### 4. Completing Work
1. **Push branch** to origin
2. **Create Pull Request** with Linear issue reference in title
3. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT comment "completed" on Linear issues until PR is merged
4. **Linear auto-moves** to "Done" when PR is merged (if automation enabled)

## StereoKit Guidelines

### Hand Tracking Features
- Test on Quest 3 for reliability
- Use hysteresis for gesture detection (0.7+ start, 0.3 release)
- Implement proper state management and UI feedback

### Event Systems
- Use proper C# event patterns with helper methods for invocation
- Implement cleanup in dispose patterns when needed

## Linear Team Configuration

### Git Automations Required
- ✅ Move issue to "In Progress" when branch is created
- ✅ Move issue to "Done" when PR is merged
- ✅ Add PR link to issue when created

### Branch Naming
- Use Linear's suggested branch names: `username/issue-id-description`

## StereoKit Specific Guidelines

### Hand Tracking Features
- Always test on Quest 3 for reliability
- Use hysteresis for gesture detection to prevent flickering
- Implement proper state management for gesture recognition
- Add comprehensive UI feedback for debugging

### Event Systems
- Use proper C# event patterns with null-conditional operators
- Implement cleanup in dispose patterns when needed
- Log important gesture events for debugging

### Quest 3 Optimizations
- Higher thresholds for gesture detection (0.7+ for pinch start)
- Lower release thresholds (0.3) to prevent premature releases
- Account for hand tracking latency and noise

## Tools Integration
- Use Linear MCP for issue management
- Use GitHub integration for PR creation
- Leverage Cursor's git integration for commits
- Test Quest 3 features in actual VR environment
